talkiepi is a headless capable Mumble client written in Go, written for walkie talkie style communication on the Raspberry Pi.

This project is a fork of [Daniel Chote's](https://github.com/dchote) original [talkiepi project](https://github.com/dchote/talkiepi). It is different because it uses only off-the-shelf components and requires no soldering.


## Hardware

The hardware is based around a Raspberry Pi Zero and SeeedStudio ReSpeaker 2-mic Pi HAT. A full bill of materials with links to suppliers will be added shortly.


## 3D printable enclosure

The stl geometry will soon be made availble in the stl directory.


## Installing talkiepi

I have put together an install guide [here](doc/README.md).
